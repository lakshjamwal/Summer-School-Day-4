        <h2>1. Baldur's Gate 3</h2>

        <p>Baldur's Gate 3 is not only the best RPG around, but it also topped our pick of the best games of 2023. And it's no wonder when you consider the depth and breadth of Larian's adventure. In fact, we're still playing this game today, and it's raised the bar high for every new RPG that comes our way.

With so much freedom to shape your journey, the Sword Coast is a veritable playground for you to experiment - whether that be with the abilities of your chosen class, what decisions you make during major story beats, or who - if anyone - you decide to romance as you try to deal with the tadpole lodged in your brain. With a memorable cast of characters, fantastic storytelling, and choices with impactful consequences, Baldur's Gate 3 is a massively engrossing experience that is leading the charge when it comes to the modern RPG landscape..</p>

        <h2>2. Elden Ring</h2>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nUk7bVbZSMGs7cfQHvgT7H-970-80.jpg.webp" alt="elden ring">
        <p>Elden Ring introduces you to a breathtakingly beautiful world filled with bizarre, twisted lore that's the result of a collab between George R. R. Martin and Hidetaka Miyazaki - and you'll never want to leave it. From poison swamps to cursed kings, The Lands Between is fascinating and fearsome. Elden Ring is an absolute beast, taking the best parts of the FromSoftware formula and injecting them with refreshing new elements that attract veteran and beginner players alike.
If you want to avoid that big, bad boss early on in the game, hop on your horse Torrent and level up a bit, or find a better weapon tucked away in a castle full of mean magicians. There are tons of options for players that mean countless permutations of weapon, armor, and stat builds; giving you so many ways to play this game you can easily justify a playthrough or two (or three).</p>

        <h2>3. Assassin's Creed Odyssey</h2>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5MSUjE9cr96qCkyg5YFCEo-1200-80.jpg.webp" alt="assaincreed">
        <p>If you couldn't tell already from our five-star Assassin’s Creed Odyssey review, this is a leap forward for Ubisoft’s stabby series. For the first time, you have NPCs to romance (whether you want to be a Casanova or as chaste as a saint), and dialogue options. Then combine those brand-new features with the return of naval combat and enough side-quests, locations, and hidden secrets to keep you busy for days, and you've got Odyssey.
Your misthios (mercenary) Alexios or Kassandra is truly yours to shape however you wish. With nine endings to unlock, the way you end specific quests will end up impacting the world around you, whether that’s for the better or worse. You know what that means? Multiple playthroughs. If you dare, of course, as you will be kept busy for over 100 hours if you choose to explore everywhere and do everything (and everyone). This RPG put the Assassin's Creed series on a new path - one that both Assassin's Creed Origins and Assassin's Creed Valhalla would go on to follow.</p>

        <h2>4. Bloodborne</h2>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JmpSEJEgp5g94NvQtbdBeC-1200-80.jpg.webp" alt="Bloodborne">
        <p>Welcome to Yarnum, a gloomy, somber city straight out of a gothic novel whose inhabitants are suffering through a plague – not just of the illness type, but also the dangerous beasts type. Yarnum, despite being the last place you'd want to visit IRL, will entice you, begging you to return back to it long after you've bested its worst. 
You'll want to knock on more doors and hear the bizarre cackles of villagers, or walk along another rooftop in an attempt to find a hidden mystery. Our Bloodborne review points out how this is a near-perfect game, and for good reason. Bloodborne's streamlined RPG elements have you working with six stats, and the character creator lets you design some of the coolest Victorian Gothic heroes ever. The hats, man, the hats are so cool..</p>

        <h2>5. Cyberpunk 2077</h2>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5uWH5fabHYKH4n2qXZyadh-1200-80.jpg.webp" alt="cyberpunk">
        <p>Cyberpunk 2077 has come a long way since it first launched in 2020, with a myriad of improvements, updates that add more to the experience, and the recent launch of the Phantom Liberty DLC featuring an espionage-shaped adventure starring Idris Elba.
Following the journey of V, who sets out to save their own life after a gig takes a very bad turn, you get swept up in the goings-on of Night City with an engram of an infamous rockerboy by the name of Johnny Silverhand, aka Keanu Reeves. With a host of characters to meet along the way - and some you can develop a relationship with if you so choose - the neon-tinted RPG takes you on quite a ride.</p>
